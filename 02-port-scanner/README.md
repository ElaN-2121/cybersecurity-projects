# üîé Port Scanner

A multi-threaded TCP port scanner built in Python. This tool allows scanning single ports or ranges, listing open ports, and performing basic banner grabbing for service identification.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Use Warning**
> This tool is intended for **educational and authorized use only**. Unauthorized port scanning may be illegal.

## üöÄ Features

* Scan a single port or a range/list of ports (e.g., `22`, `20-100`, or `22,80,443,1000-2000`)
* Multi-threaded scanning for improved performance (`--threads`)
* Optional banner grabbing for basic service fingerprinting (`--banner`)
* Safety cap on maximum ports to prevent accidental large scans
* Graceful error handling (timeouts, DNS issues, keyboard interrupts)
* Beginner-friendly and easy to extend

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python **3.9+** (tested on 3.10/3.11)
* Uses only the Python standard library

Optional for development:
* `pytest` for testing
* `ruff` or `flake8` for linting
* `black` for code formatting

## ‚ö° Usage

```bash
# Scan a single port
python port_scanner.py --target 127.0.0.1 --port 22
# Scan a range of ports
python port_scanner.py --target example.com --ports 20-1024
# Scan multiple ranges/ports
python port_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.10 --ports 22,80,443,8000-8100
# Enable banner grabbing
python port_scanner.py --target example.com --ports 21-25 --banner
# Adjust performance parameters
python port_scanner.py --target localhost --ports 1-1024 --threads 200 --timeout 0.5
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (if applicable)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# Run tests
pytest
```
Includes sample tests for port parsing and scanning against a local test server.

## üõ† Development

* Lint code: `ruff check .` or `flake8 .`
* Format code: `black .`
* Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions workflow runs linting and tests on every push


## üèó Future Improvements

* Asyncio implementation for non-blocking scans
* Enhanced protocol probes (e.g., HTTP HEAD, SMTP EHLO)
* Export results to JSON/CSV
* Docker containerization for portability
